# DrEye: Exploiting Color Space Geometry for Visual Stimulus Design across Animals

Dreye is still being actively developed and tested, and documentation will be added soon. Currently, we are redesigning some of the API in order to make it easier to use and speed up some of our algorithms. Our redesign will be finished by mid-November, but our old API will remain for backwards compatibility

## Installation

```
pip install dreye
```
